\title{Species table for common RREAS species and species groups}
\format{
A data frame with 12 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{SPECIES}{Species code}
\item{MATURITY}{Maturity code}
\item{NAME}{Name}
}
}
\usage{
sptable

\description{
Table of species and species groups for which indices are commonly
reported in ecosystem assessments. Includes notes on irregularities
in species classifications.
}
\details{
We include notes here on some irregularities in species classifications
in the RREAS database. With the exception of myctophids, these species are
not in \code{sptable}, but users who want to generate a species table for these
species or species groups should be aware of these inconsistencies.
Information can also be found in the SPECIES_CODES table.

\strong{Myctophids:} Blue lanternfish (685) and California headlightfish (192) have
always been identified to species and separated from unknown myctophids
(407). Over time, more myctophids (e.g. Northern lampfish (661), California
lanternfish (669)) have been identified to species and no longer classified
as 407. Thus, depending on the survey year, 407 encompasses different
species.

\strong{Squids:} Market squid (1101) have always been identified to species and
separated from unknown squid (1918). Over time, more squid have been
identified to species and no longer classified as 1918. Thus, depending on
the survey year, 1918 encompasses different species.

\strong{Heteropods:} Prior to 2016, all heteropods were classified as unknown
heteropods (1869). In 2016, this category was split into Carinaria (2050) and
Pterotrachea (2853).

\strong{Smelts:} Prior to 2018, all smelts were classified as unknown smelt (453).
Starting in 2018, adult smelt were identified to species. Larval smelt
remained classified as 453.

\strong{Eelpouts:} Prior to CRUISE 8806, eelpouts were not consistently identified. Many
unknown eelpouts (743) were probably pallid eelpouts (359). Starting with
CRUISE 8806, pallid eelpouts were consistently identified to species and separated from
unknown eelpouts.

\strong{Dragonfish:} Prior to 1990, dragonfish were not consistently identified. Many
unknown dragonfish (378) were likely longfin dragonfish (681). Starting in
1990, longfin dragonfish were consistently identified to species and separated from
unknown dragonfish.
